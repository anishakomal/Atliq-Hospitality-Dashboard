## 📌 Problem Statement  
Atliq Grands, a leading five-star hotel chain in India, has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. However, due to competitive market strategies and ineffective management decisions, they are losing market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel categories.  

To regain their position, the Managing Director has decided to implement **Business and Data Intelligence**. However, the company lacks an in-house data analytics team, so they have hired a third-party service provider to extract insights from historical data and assist the revenue management team in making data-driven decisions.
